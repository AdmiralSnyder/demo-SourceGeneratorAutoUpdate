# this file contains the projects that should be auto-reloaded after the build of a generator.
# there's 2 ways to have the projects referenced here:
# 1: fully-qualified paths to the .csproj files - if other extensions are needed, please file an issue at:
# https://github.com/AdmiralSnyder/Support-SourceGeneratorAutoUpdate/issues/new
# 2: relative folders within the VS solution hierarchy (in case you have your projects inside of Solution folders)
